# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:It is a systematic application tool used to develop and maintain software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1.Requirement - Gathering & documenting the needs of a user and the requirements for the system 
2.Design - Designing detailed & the correct level of the software architecture and user interface 
3.Implementation - That is coding and building the software according to the design specified
4.Testing - Where you Run test to affirm the quality standards and its functional requirements 
5.Deployment - After testing and affirming having meet the required standards and meets users satisfaction you now release the software to the customers
6.Maintainance - This is after deploying you make follow ups on the changes and the updates to fit the users environment 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
-It's where you discover the needs as per the society and finding out ways to solve-where the problem solving techniques is the requirements. 
You will need to gather anx document the needs of users all round as it will be of more importance finding out the solutions to the problems facing the users. 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
