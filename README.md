# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

It is a systematic application tool used to develop and maintain software systems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering encompasses a broad and disciplined approach to software development, focusing on processes, quality assurance, documentation, and teamwork While the Traditional Programming is more narrowly focused on coding and implementation, often without the structured processes and formal methodologies found in software engineering.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

1.Requirement - Gathering & documenting the needs of a user and the requirements for the system 
2.Design - Designing detailed & the correct level of the software architecture and user interface 
3.Implementation - That is coding and building the software according to the design specified
4.Testing - Where you Run test to affirm the quality standards and its functional requirements 
5.Deployment - After testing and affirming having meet the required standards and meets users satisfaction you now release the software to the customers
6.Maintainance - This is after deploying you make follow ups on the changes and the updates to fit the users environment 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:
- Waterfall This is where the developers approach with distinct phases checking the  requirements, designs flowing downwards like a waterfall.Compared to  Agile where Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to changes over time

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering-it is a systematic process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system by the developers.

I) Requirements Elicitation- Gathering requirements from stakeholders through  various like interviews, surveys, observations
ii) Requirements Analysis- Analyzing the gathered requirements to resolve any conflicts and ensure they are complete.
iii) Requirements Specification-Documenting the requirements in a clear and detailed manner using formal methods.
iv) Requirements Validation- Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs
v) Requirements Management-Managing changes to requirements of the user needs throughout the software development lifecycle to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.

-It's where you discover the needs as per the society and finding out ways to solve-where the problem solving techniques is the requirements. 
You will need to gather and document the needs of users all round as it will be of more importance finding out the solutions to the problems facing the users. 

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:
-Reusability: Modules can be repeated across different parts of the projects developments hence ease of maintainance
-Interchangeability-Modules have well-defined interfaces, they can be replaced or updated independently as long as they adhere to the specifications 

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:
  - Unit Testing-This involves testing individual components of software as part of early developments to make sure there best quality. 
 - Integration Testing-its esting interactions between different components of the sofrware
  - System Testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole to make sure it is to the standards specified by he user
 - Acceptance Testing- Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user specifications - Testing is very necessary to avoid the defects when it comes to end results that can't satisfy the user needs

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
-This are Software tool used for tracking changes to the source code and managing work among the developers over time. It is really very much important for it updates the developers of any new coding so as to equip developers with the right knowledge at the moment and be able to face the current situations in the society.e.g Gitlab,Subversion & Github  which handles large projects very well and faster. It allows each user have full copy of their repository safe and secure


Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance: 
 - Project Manager Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
-Resource managing
-Risks conrol
-Quality assurance 
-Documentations and reports generations


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

-Software Maintenance is the process of modifying and updating software applications after their initial development to correct faults, improve performance & enhance its features over time

a) Corrective Maintenance addresses faults in the software to ensure it functions correctly.
b) Adaptive Maintenance ensures the software remains operational in changing environments.
c) Perfective Maintenance enhances the software by adding new features and improving its performance.
d) Preventive Maintenance focuses on preventing future issues and improving the overall maintainability of the software.
-It is important as it ensures the long-term functionality, performance and relevance of a software system.
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
a) Changing requirements-it may change over time during the development cycle leading to project delays

b) Tight deadlines-Pressure to deliver the software in a specified time can lead to rushed development hence compromised quality softwares

c) Technical debt-this accrue from shortcuts solutions and this affects future advancement efforts and leads to increase in development costs

-This challenges can be overcomes by doing  day in day out reassessment of projects goals and timelines as well maintain effective communication with developers
a) Sustainability/durability-> Due to fast changing world, developing the softwares where it needs to satisfy the customers is so challenging compared to how the seasons changes rapidly. It can be solved by day to day research so that software engineers can stayed inform each time
b) Security - making sure the software developed is safe from malwares and threats. This can be avoided too by working together as the software engineers to come up with solid result. 
c) Privacy ensuring customers data is well kept and secured
